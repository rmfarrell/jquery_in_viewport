##Set a class if an element is in the viewport

###Takes 2 params:

1. A hash of padding you'd like to add to the window expressed as percentages (e.g. 10, 25) so elements at the very edges don't have their classes toggled. options are available for top, bottom, left and right. Defaults are all 0.
2. a custom class that's toggled when the element comes into the active area of the viewport. Default is 'in-view'.
